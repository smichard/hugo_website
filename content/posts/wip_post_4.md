# Introduction
When I was still working as a scientist I regularly attended conferences. By attending conferences, I always learned an incredible amount in a short time. Science thrives on discourse. Open exchange with colleagues and feedback from experts helped me to advance my research. In addition, conferences are a great way to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in your field. They provide an opportunity to meet other researchers in your field and make professional connections. Attending conferences can help to advance your career by increasing your visibility and credibility in your field. Finally, I found conferences to be an inspiration for my own research.  
Now that I work in the industry, I still see the same benefits in attending conferences, so I try to keep attending one to two conferences a year. The last few years have been difficult due to the pandemic, with many conferences canceled or only held virtually.  
Hence, this year I was happy to see that the FOSDEM conference was back after a two-year break. This year the conference took place on February 4th and 5th in Brussels.


# Visiting FOSDEM
FOSDEM - Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting - is a non-profit, community-driven event that brings together thousands of open-source enthusiasts from around the world. The conference takes place annually in Brussels at the Free University of Brussels (Universit√© libre de Bruxelles - ULB) and is considered to be one of the largest annual gatherings of open-source developers in Europe.  
FOSDEM is organized by volunteers and is entirely free to attend. The conference features a wide range of talks, presentations, and workshops, covering a variety of topics such as Linux, cloud computing, databases, web development, and much more. Additionally, there are several tracks dedicated to specific development communities such as Python, Java, and Go.

# Sponsors
The funding concept of the conference is also interesting and perhaps a bit unusual. The conference is free for visitors to attend and is mainly supported by sponsors, T-shirt sales, and voluntary donations.

# Summary
I found FOSDEM to be an excellent opportunity for developers, solution architects, and open-source enthusiasts, in general, to connect with others in their field, learn about the latest developments, and contribute to the open-source community.
