Sometimes, you meet someone without knowing the lasting impact they’ll have on your life.

I had the privilege of meeting Prof. Queisser during my time at the University of New South Wales, where I was working as a student researcher at the ARC Photovoltaics Centre of Excellence around 2009/2010. I still vividly remember sitting at my desk when Gavin Conibeer, behind me, said, “Hans, may I introduce you to Stephan Michard.” I hadn't known Prof. Queisser was visiting the institute —and there I was, wearing shorts and flip flops in proper Aussie style, suddenly face to face with a true legend in our field.

Prof. Queisser stayed for about two weeks. During that time, we had several lunches together and some truly memorable conversations. I was deeply impressed by his openness and curiosity — he didn’t care that I was “just a student”. He took real interest in who I was and what I was working on, offering encouragement and thoughtful advice.

Later, he played a pivotal role in helping me secure a PhD position at the Forschungszentrum Jülich, supporting my application with a letter of recommendation.
In a private message, he wrote:  
**“Now make something of it.”**  
I took that as a challenge, a mission and a source of motivation.

Prof. Queisser’s guidance opened doors for me, and his example continues to inspire me to this day. I will remember him with deep gratitude — as a towering figure in science, and as someone who took the time to care.
