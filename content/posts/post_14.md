# Introduction
On October 1st, I was promoted to Associate Principal Solution Architect at Red Hat. This milestone marks not just a new title, but also an opportunity to reflect on the journey of the past two years.

# Reflections
Time has passed remarkably quickly since I joined Red Hat in mid-2023. In that period, I’ve had the privilege to:
- Work with highly skilled and deeply technical colleagues across Europe.
- Engage in diverse and challenging projects, many of which operate at the forefront of technology.
- Learn about, conduct POCs, and deliver workshops in the exciting and fast-moving field of AI.
- Deepen my own expertise by pursuing and completing several Red Hat certifications.

It has been a journey of constant learning, collaboration, and growth. There were moments of trial and error, but each step forward brought valuable insights.

## Looking Ahead
This promotion is not a finish line but rather a signal to run a bit faster, continue learning, and contribute more. I am grateful to my mentor, my manager, and my colleagues at Red Hat who have guided, challenged, and supported me throughout this journey.

The path ahead is dynamic, and I look forward to building further, learning more, and — hopefully — still keeping a smile on the way.
