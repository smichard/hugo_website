# Introduction
Last year I had the chance to participate in a podcast. I was invited by *Vogel IT*, a German publishing house, as a guest for the Insider Research Podcast. I talked about various topics with podcast host Oliver Schonschek. A central aspect was how to implement and operate customer projects in a multi-cloud world and how to ensure data security.  
At the beginning of the podcast, we talk about cloud computing as an operating model and then talk about how to use software-driven storage to deploy storage targets independent of their landing zone. We talked about how Project Alpine from Dell Technologies can be used to create a homogeneous storage layer across various landing zones and the benefits this brings. Then, we talked about how companies can protect their mission-critical data from cyber attacks. Finally, we talked about how to realize storage persistence for Kubernetes workloads using the Container Storage Module provided by Dell Technologies.  

# Storage and data management for a multi-cloud world
The podcast is described in the show notes with the following text:  
One of the biggest challenges in the era of multi-cloud is that data is increasingly distributed across on-premises data centers, colocation facilities, and public clouds. The lack of consistency between these environments leads to increased costs, but also compliance and governance issues. How do you achieve consistent storage and data management from on-premises to the various clouds?

# Summary
After my interview with the German media outlet *Computerwoche*, the podcast was my second interaction with a press medium in the last year. Here, too, it was very interesting to take part in the production process. The exchange with Oliver Schonschek was interesting and it was impressive to see how professionally the podcast was moderated and produced.
