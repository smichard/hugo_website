# LinkedIn Announcement

Dear LinkedIn Network,

I wanted to take a moment to announce my departure from Dell Technologies.

Today marks the culmination of an incredible journey that began 8.5 years ago when I joined EMC as an Associate Systems Engineer through the GSAP program. Looking back, I regard my tenure at Dell Technologies with deep gratitude. It's an experience I wouldn't trade for anything.

Throughout my journey, I've had the privilege of collaborating with a myriad of customers across diverse industries, each with their unique and exciting projects. Witnessing one of the largest mergers in tech history up close will always be a career highlight for me.

Indeed, it's the people who truly make a difference. I've had the pleasure of working with exceptional teammates across all company levels. Along the way, colleagues have turned into friends, and leaders have transformed into role models. I'm moving forward armed with a wealth of experiences and fond memories.

Finally, I'd like to extend my heartfelt thanks to all customers, partners, and Dell teammates who were part of this journey. I wish you all nothing but the very best.

Best,

Stephan
