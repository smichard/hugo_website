# LinkedIn Announcement

Greetings to my LinkedIn network,

I am thrilled to share that I joined Red Hat as a Senior Solutions Architect July 1st. This new chapter of my career is an exciting one, and I am very much looking forward to what lies ahead.

To my new colleagues at Red Hat, I am eager to meet and collaborate with you. For my partners, old and new, I am excited to embark on this journey with you.

A quote from the renowned German poet, Hermann Hesse, resonates with my feelings at the start of this journey: "Jedem Anfang wohnt ein Zauber inne", which translates to "A magic dwells in each beginning". Indeed, the magic of new beginnings is palpable and I am ready to embrace this wonderful journey with open arms.

Many thanks to Manju Rajput for support and guidance through the hiring process.

Cheers

Stephan
