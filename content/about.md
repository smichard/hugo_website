# hello world
This website was created as an experiment and a way for me to keep track of the various pieces of content I create or am featured in. Occasionally I am interviewed for a newspaper or podcast, or I sometimes create my own texts and technical documentation. The idea is to share useful content on an irregular basis.  
When creating this website, my focus was to use a simple framework that allows me to publish content quickly and easily. Therefore, I use the Hugo framework to generate static web pages and host them on Google Cloud. Google Cloud allows through the services Cloud Build and Cloud Run to create and publish a container very easily, quickly, and cost-efficiently. I outline the exact workflow in my first post: [Website setup and workflow]({{< ref "/posts/post_1" >}} "Website setup and workflow").

My name is Stephan Michard, I was born and raised close to Cologne. My interest in science, physics, and technology, in general, led me to pursue studies of electrical engineering at the technical university in Aachen and at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. At the end of my studies, I joined the Institute for Energy and Climate Research in Jülich to work on my Diploma thesis. Subsequently, I stayed in Jülich as a research scientist to pursue a PhD thesis in solar cell research. After some time as a postdoc, I decided to join a US-based technology company. In my role, I work with customers across Germany to develop and implement digital business strategies. I provide consultancy at a strategic level and work with a team of specialists to create the necessary IT infrastructure solutions. I specialize in designing data center and cloud platform solutions on a global scale and have expertise in areas such as software-defined storage, hyper-converged infrastructure, cloud solutions, app development, and developer experience.  
During my free time, I enjoy being outdoors and participating in endurance sports like cycling and running. I am currently training for my next half marathon. Alongside this, I like to listen to podcasts:
