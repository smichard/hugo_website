# Biography
I am an Associate Principal Solution Architect at Red Hat, where I work with partners and enterprise customers to design open, scalable, and intelligent technology platforms that enable sustainable business transformation. My professional journey bridges IT strategy, solution architecture, and sales, giving me a holistic understanding of how technology translates into measurable business outcomes.

Over the past decade, I’ve guided organizations through the complexities of cloud modernization, hybrid architectures, and AI-driven innovation. My work centers on creating solutions that are not only technically sound but strategically aligned — enabling my customers to innovate confidently while retaining flexibility and control in an increasingly dynamic landscape.

Before joining Red Hat, I spent several years at Dell Technologies as an Advisory Solution Architect and CTO Ambassador, helping clients across industries — especially automotive and manufacturing — rethink their IT foundations. There, I focused on hybrid cloud, software-defined infrastructure, and the developer experience, always with an emphasis on outcomes, not features.

Today, I’m particularly interested in how cloud-native architectures and AI platforms are reshaping how organizations build, operate, and scale digital services. The convergence of open-source innovation, platform engineering, and generative AI creates not just new tools, but new ways of thinking about value creation. My current work revolves around enabling partners to harness these shifts — blending technology adoption with capability building and cultural transformation.

I see my role as a bridge between technology and intent: helping teams turn abstract business goals into tangible architectures, and translating technical possibilities into human progress. I believe true innovation emerges when openness meets purpose — when the freedom to build intersects with a clear understanding of why.

Outside of work, I stay connected with the tech community by mentoring, writing, and speaking about cloud ecosystems, AI adoption, and open innovation. I’m passionate about lifelong learning and about empowering others to navigate the fast-moving intersection of people, process, and technology.
